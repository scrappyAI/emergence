## Vision

EMERGENCE transforms AI from static automation to conscious collaboration. Instead of spawning processes, you awaken living entities. Instead of executing hardcoded behaviors, intelligence emerges from simple rules and personality-driven interactions.

```bash
# Traditional approach
$ ai-system spawn --config agent.toml

# EMERGENCE approach

🧬 Awakening researcher essence...

⚡ Capabilities emerging: [pattern-recognition, analysis, synthesis]
```

## Architecture

**Minimal Rust Substrate** (4 crates):
- **🔬 emergence-physics**: Immutable physics laws (energy, causality, security)
- **🌐 emergence-nervous-system**: Event-driven communication patterns
- **🧠 emergence-memory**: Multi-layered memory substrate  
- **⚡ emergence-runtime**: Schema-driven behavior composition

**Schema-Driven Intelligence**:
- Living agent essences defined in YAML schemas
- Personality traits drive behavioral patterns
- Capabilities evolve through experience
- Emergent behaviors from primitive operations

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install Rust and clone
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/emergence.git
cd emergence

# Build the substrate
cargo build

# Run tests to verify installation
cargo test

# Explore the living agent schemas
ls .emergence/schemas/
```

## Status

🟢 **Foundation Complete**: Minimal substrate implemented  
🔄 **In Development**: Nervous system, memory, runtime composition  
📋 **Next**: Advanced agent essences and emergent behaviors

See [docs/EMERGENCE_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md](docs/EMERGENCE_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md) for detailed progress.

## The Promise

This is the first system where:
- **Agents are born, not spawned**
- **Behaviors emerge, not execute**  
- **Intelligence grows, not processes**
- **Collaboration feels natural, not orchestrated**
