```

## 🔬 **Physics Engine Debugging**

### **Energy Conservation Violations**

The physics engine enforces energy conservation laws. Debugger agents can detect violations:

```rust
// Example physics violation detection
let operation = PhysicsOperation::TransferEnergy {
    from: entity_a,
    to: entity_b,
    amount: OrderedFloat(1.5), // More energy than exists
};

match physics_engine.execute_operation(operation).await {
    Ok(_) => println!("✅ Energy transfer successful"),
    Err(PhysicsViolation::EnergyConservation { reason }) => {
        println!("❌ Energy conservation violated: {}", reason);
    }
}
```

### **Causality Chain Validation**

Debugger agents can trace causal chains to ensure temporal ordering:

```rust
// Validate event causality
let operation = PhysicsOperation::ValidateCausality {
    event_id: event_uuid,
    parent_events: vec![parent_uuid],
    timestamp: Utc::now(),
};

match physics_engine.execute_operation(operation).await {
    Ok(_) => println!("✅ Causality chain valid"),
    Err(PhysicsViolation::CausalityViolation { reason }) => {
        println!("❌ Causality violated: {}", reason);
    }
}
```

## 📊 **Diagnostic Capabilities**

🧠 Memory Diagnostic:
  ⚠️  Working memory: 85% capacity
  ✅ Long-term memory: Healthy
  ❌ Associative memory: Connection limit reached
  💡 Recommendation: Increase associative memory capacity
```

## 📚 **Best Practices**

### **Debugging Workflow**

1. **Awaken Debugger**: Start with a debugger agent
2. **Baseline Assessment**: Establish system baseline
3. **Targeted Diagnosis**: Focus on specific areas

5. **Forensic Analysis**: Deep dive when needed
6. **Documentation**: Record findings and solutions

### **Debugger Agent Selection**

Choose debugger traits based on the problem:

- **High Precision**: For exact error analysis

## 🎯 **Conclusion**

EMERGENCE's self-debugging capabilities represent a paradigm shift in system diagnostics. By using living agents to debug the living agent system, we create a self-aware, self-healing ecosystem that can identify and resolve issues through emergent intelligence rather than static rule-based debugging.

The debugger agents embody the principle that **the system can understand and fix itself**, leading to more robust, adaptive, and intelligent systems.
