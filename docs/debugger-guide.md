## Search Strategies

The debugger uses various search strategies to optimize its diagnostic capabilities:

### Initial Strategies
1. **Breadth-First**: Systematic search through all components
2. **Depth-First**: Deep dive into specific components
3. **Heuristic**: Pattern-based search using historical data
4. **Adaptive**: Self-modifying search based on failures

### Generated Strategies
- **Enhanced Adaptive**: Improved adaptive strategy based on failure patterns
- **Pattern-Based**: Strategy that avoids previously failed patterns
- **Code-Aware**: Strategy optimized based on code complexity analysis

### Strategy Metrics
Each strategy tracks:
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of successful diagnoses
- **Energy Efficiency**: Energy consumption per diagnosis
- **Complexity**: Computational complexity of the strategy
- **Usage Count**: Number of times used
- **Last Used**: Timestamp of last usage

## Self-Optimization Process

### 1. Failure Detection
When a diagnosis fails or is incomplete, the debugger:
- Records the failed attempt with context
- Analyzes the search pattern used
- Identifies the failure reason
- Tracks energy expended

### 2. Pattern Analysis
The debugger analyzes failure patterns to:
- Identify common failure modes
- Understand which strategies work best for different scenarios
- Detect system-specific issues
- Learn from repeated failures

### 3. Strategy Generation
Based on failure analysis, the debugger generates:
- **Enhanced Strategies**: Improved versions of existing strategies
- **Pattern-Avoiding Strategies**: Strategies that avoid known failure patterns
- **Context-Aware Strategies**: Strategies adapted to specific system characteristics

### 4. Performance Tracking
The debugger continuously tracks:
- Strategy success rates with exponential moving averages
- Energy efficiency improvements
- Complexity vs. effectiveness trade-offs
- Usage patterns and frequency

### 5. Code Analysis
The debugger can analyze its own code to:
- Identify optimization opportunities
- Calculate complexity metrics
- Generate improvement suggestions
- Adapt strategies based on code characteristics

## Optimization Examples

### Example 1: Physics Engine Issues
```bash
# Initial diagnosis fails
diagnose
# Result: Physics engine not responding

# Debugger records failure and optimizes
# Generated strategy: enhanced_adaptive
# Focuses on physics-specific diagnostic patterns

# Retry with optimized strategy
diagnose
# Result: Successful diagnosis with physics engine details
```

### Example 2: Energy System Problems
```bash
# Monitor energy system
energy

# If issues detected, trigger optimization
optimize

# New strategies generated based on energy-specific patterns
strategies
# Shows new energy-aware strategies
```

### Example 3: Code Complexity Analysis
```bash
# Analyze debugger's own code
analyze

# Results show complexity and optimization opportunities
# Debugger generates code-aware strategies
# Strategies adapted to handle complex code patterns
```
